# Contributing to EazyPaste

We love your input! We want to make contributing to EazyPaste as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run electron:dev`

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the version numbers in package.json following [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
