# Current Tasks and Progress

## What needs to be achieved
- Full implementation of the ChatGPT Code Prompt Generator using Electron and Vue.js
- Implementation of all features specified in projectGoal.md
- Cross-platform compatibility and proper build process
- Beautiful dark mode UI similar to Discord/VSCode

## What is already achieved ✅
- Basic Electron + Vue.js project setup
- Configuration panel implementation with:
  - Hidden files/folders configuration
  - Intro/Rules text configuration
- Local data storage using electron-store
- Fixed TypeScript configuration and build process
- Fixed GPU cache issues in Electron main process
- Fixed folder selection functionality
- Improved error handling and IPC communication
- Basic dark mode implementation
- IPC handlers for:
  - Folder selection
  - File reading
  - Data storage
  - Folder tree structure
- Fixed preload script loading issues
- Fixed store data serialization issues
- Fixed folder tree data serialization
- Improved folder tree error handling
- Added better type information for tree nodes
- Basic folder and file visibility in tree view
- Added folder expansion UI elements
- Added file selection checkboxes
- Added token count display
- Added file separators and paths in context

## What is blocked ❌
- Folder expansion not showing child files/folders despite UI elements being present
- File selection state not updating properly in the UI
- Token count and copy button placement needs to be at the top of the interface
- Real-time UI updates for file selection not working correctly

## What is in progress ⚙️
- ⚙️ Fixing folder tree data population for expanded folders
- ⚙️ Improving file selection state reactivity
- ⚙️ Reorganizing PromptBuilder layout
- ⚙️ Enhancing UI update responsiveness

## What is next ⚠️
- Fix folder expansion to properly show nested files and folders
- Fix file selection state reactivity and UI updates
- Move token count and copy button to top of interface
- Improve UI responsiveness for file selection
- Complete folder tree view implementation
- Add file content preview
- Implement prompt building logic
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Implement proper build and packaging process

## Components and Files Created
1. Main Process (Electron):
   - `electron/main.ts`: Main process with IPC handlers
   - `electron/preload.ts`: Preload script for IPC

2. Renderer Process (Vue):
   - `src/components/ConfigPanel.vue`: Configuration panel component
   - `src/components/FolderTree.vue`: Folder selection and tree view component
   - `src/components/TreeNode.vue`: Tree node component for folder structure
   - `src/components/PromptBuilder.vue`: Prompt building component
   - `src/App.vue`: Main application component

3. Configuration:
   - `vite.config.ts`: Build and development configuration
   - `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Notes
- The application is now running without GPU cache errors
- Basic configuration persistence is working
- The project structure follows the recommended Electron + Vue.js architecture
- Folder selection is now working properly with error handling
- Dark mode styling has been improved
- Component communication has been simplified using v-model
- Store data is now properly serialized for IPC communication
- Folder tree data is now properly serialized and includes type information
- Added comprehensive error handling for folder tree operations
- Folder expansion UI is in place but not showing content
- File selection state not properly reflecting in UI
- Need to reorganize PromptBuilder layout
- Need to improve UI responsiveness for file selection
