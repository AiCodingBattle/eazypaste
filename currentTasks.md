# Current Tasks and Progress

## What needs to be achieved
- Full implementation of the ChatGPT Code Prompt Generator using Electron and Vue.js
- Implementation of all features specified in projectGoal.md
- Cross-platform compatibility and proper build process
- Beautiful dark mode UI similar to Discord/VSCode

## What is already achieved ✅
- Basic Electron + Vue.js project setup
- Configuration panel implementation with:
  - Hidden files/folders configuration (UI only)
  - Intro/Rules text configuration
- Local data storage using electron-store
- Fixed TypeScript configuration and build process
- Fixed GPU cache issues in Electron main process
- Fixed folder selection functionality
- Improved error handling and IPC communication
- Basic dark mode implementation
- IPC handlers for:
  - Folder selection
  - File reading
  - Data storage
  - Folder tree structure
  - Path operations
- Fixed preload script loading issues
- Fixed store data serialization issues
- Fixed folder tree data serialization
- Improved folder tree error handling
- Added better type information for tree nodes
- Basic folder and file visibility in tree view
- Added folder expansion UI elements
- Added file selection checkboxes
- Added token count display
- Added file separators and paths in context
- Fixed file selection state reactivity
- Fixed path module issues with IPC handlers

## What is blocked ❌
- Folder expansion shows UI elements but no content despite files existing
- Hidden Files/Folders textfield is not editable
- Copy Full Prompt button placement needs to be between User's Task and Selected Files Preview
- Tree data not properly populating for expanded folders

## What is in progress ⚙️
- ⚙️ Fixing folder tree data population for expanded folders
- ⚙️ Making Hidden Files/Folders field editable
- ⚙️ Reorganizing PromptBuilder layout for copy button
- ⚙️ Debugging tree data structure issues

## What is next ⚠️
- Fix folder expansion to properly show nested files and folders
- Make Hidden Files/Folders field editable and functional
- Move Copy Full Prompt button between sections
- Debug and fix tree data population
- Complete folder tree view implementation
- Add file content preview
- Implement prompt building logic
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Implement proper build and packaging process

## Components and Files Created
1. Main Process (Electron):
   - `electron/main.ts`: Main process with IPC handlers
   - `electron/preload.ts`: Preload script for IPC

2. Renderer Process (Vue):
   - `src/components/ConfigPanel.vue`: Configuration panel component
   - `src/components/FolderTree.vue`: Folder selection and tree view component
   - `src/components/TreeNode.vue`: Tree node component for folder structure
   - `src/components/PromptBuilder.vue`: Prompt building component
   - `src/App.vue`: Main application component

3. Configuration:
   - `vite.config.ts`: Build and development configuration
   - `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Notes
- The application is now running without GPU cache errors
- Basic configuration persistence is working
- The project structure follows the recommended Electron + Vue.js architecture
- Folder selection is now working properly with error handling
- Dark mode styling has been improved
- Component communication has been simplified using v-model
- Store data is now properly serialized for IPC communication
- Folder tree data is now properly serialized and includes type information
- Added comprehensive error handling for folder tree operations
- File selection state is now properly reactive
- Path operations now working through IPC
- Need to fix folder expansion content display
- Need to make Hidden Files/Folders field editable
- Need to move Copy Full Prompt button location
- Need to debug tree data population issues
