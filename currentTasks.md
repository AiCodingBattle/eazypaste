# Current Tasks and Progress

## What needs to be achieved
- Full implementation of the ChatGPT Code Prompt Generator using Electron and Vue.js
- Implementation of all features specified in projectGoal.md
- Cross-platform compatibility and proper build process
- Beautiful dark mode UI similar to Discord/VSCode

## What is already achieved ✅
- Basic Electron + Vue.js project setup
- Configuration panel implementation with:
  - Hidden files/folders configuration (UI only)
  - Intro/Rules text configuration
- Local data storage using electron-store
- Fixed TypeScript configuration and build process
- Fixed GPU cache issues in Electron main process
- Fixed folder selection functionality
- Improved error handling and IPC communication
- Basic dark mode implementation
- IPC handlers for:
  - Folder selection
  - File reading
  - Data storage
  - Folder tree structure
  - Path operations
  - Dynamic folder contents loading
  - File watching and real-time updates
- Fixed preload script loading issues
- Fixed store data serialization issues
- Fixed folder tree data serialization
- Improved folder tree error handling
- Added better type information for tree nodes
- Basic folder and file visibility in tree view
- Added folder expansion UI elements
- Added file selection checkboxes
- Added token count display
- Added file separators and paths in context
- Fixed file selection state reactivity
- Fixed path module issues with IPC handlers
- ✅ Fixed folder expansion to properly show nested files and folders
- ✅ Fixed folder contents loading and serialization
- ✅ Implemented real-time file selection/deselection
- ✅ Updated default hidden files list (.git, .vscode, dist-electron, node_modules, package-lock.json, images, eslint)
- ✅ Added Select All Files functionality with toggle
- ✅ Fixed Select All Files to properly include all files in subfolders
- ✅ Added Reset to Defaults functionality
- ✅ Implemented real-time file watching with Chokidar

## What is blocked ❌
- None at the moment

## What is in progress ⚙️
- ⚙️ Moving Intro/Rules Text section to PromptBuilder between Token Count and User's Task
- ⚙️ Improving Reset button spacing in ConfigPanel

## What is next ⚠️
- Add file content preview
- Implement prompt building logic
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Implement proper build and packaging process

## Components and Files Created
1. Main Process (Electron):
   - `electron/main.ts`: Main process with IPC handlers
   - `electron/preload.ts`: Preload script for IPC

2. Renderer Process (Vue):
   - `src/components/ConfigPanel.vue`: Configuration panel component
   - `src/components/FolderTree.vue`: Folder selection and tree view component
   - `src/components/TreeNode.vue`: Tree node component for folder structure
   - `src/components/PromptBuilder.vue`: Prompt building component
   - `src/App.vue`: Main application component
   - `src/store/index.ts`: Vuex store for state management

3. Configuration:
   - `vite.config.ts`: Build and development configuration
   - `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Notes
- The application is now running without GPU cache errors
- Basic configuration persistence is working
- The project structure follows the recommended Electron + Vue.js architecture
- Folder selection is now working properly with error handling
- Dark mode styling has been improved
- Component communication has been simplified using v-model
- Store data is now properly serialized for IPC communication
- Folder tree data is now properly serialized and includes type information
- Added comprehensive error handling for folder tree operations
- File selection state is now properly reactive
- Path operations now working through IPC
- ✅ Folder expansion now properly shows nested files and folders
- ✅ File selection/deselection working in real-time
- ✅ Hidden Files/Folders field now fully functional with improved UI
- ✅ Copy Full Prompt button moved to proper location with improved UI
- ✅ Default hidden files updated with common development folders
- ✅ Added Select All Files button with toggle functionality
- ✅ Added Reset to Defaults functionality with configuration persistence
- ✅ Added real-time file watching with automatic UI updates
- ⚙️ Need to move Intro/Rules Text section to a better location
- ⚙️ Need to improve Reset button spacing
